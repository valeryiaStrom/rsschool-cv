## Summary
I've been working at [EPAM Systems](https://www.epam.com/) for 7 years.<br>

First 3 years I worked as a Software Quality Engineer. I reached a Senior QA Position and in 2019 I participated in Rolling Scopes school (2019Q3), which is something quite important to me.<br>

Despite the fact that I didn't manage to complete the program, I gained a lot of useful knowledge, which helped me eventually move to Test Automation.<br>

And now I do test automation in Javascript, and decided to try myself once again and participate in ongoing Rolling Scopes program.<br>
